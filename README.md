# calculator

Is a small attempt to create a calculator app that runs in terminal and can perform basic calculations. I haven't manage to make it follow the correct order of
calculations yet and does eveything in the order it is written. It works with a string inputed by the user and then calculates.
my.calc file has the class with the basic calculations and calculator.py the remaining program.
